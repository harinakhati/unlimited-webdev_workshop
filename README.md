# 🌱 unlimited_webdev-workshop

This repository marks the beginning of my journey into web development.  
I'm learning **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** on my own, starting from the basics.

## 📌 Purpose

To keep track of what I learn, practice new concepts, and build small things as I go.  
Right now, this is just the start — I’ll update and organize this repo better as I grow.

## 🧠 Topics I'm exploring

- HTML: structure and elements
- CSS: styling and layout
- JavaScript: basics and interaction

## ⚒️ Note

This repo will keep evolving as I continue learning. For now, it's all about experimenting and growing step by step.
